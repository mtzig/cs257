DATA: Statistics about Endangered Languages, e.g. geographic data, num speakers, endangered level

The original data was from UNESCO. However, we got the data from Kaggle which scraped from The Guardian which scraped from UNESCO.

All rights reserved to UNESCO. Permission to use the data granted on the basis that this is a personal, non-commercial project. See UNESCO's Terms of Use page for more details: http://www.unesco.org/new/en/terms-of-use/terms-of-use/copyright/

The dataset itself can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/extinct-languages, although its original source is on UNESCO's site, found here: http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&page=atlasmap (there is a button on the left navigation bar to access the dataset).

STATUS: Map of countries features a pop-up on hover which displays the name of the country, the number of endangered languages in the country, and the 5 most endangered languages of the country. Clicking on the country leads to a new page listing every endangered language of that country.
Additionally, a search bar is present on every page to allow the user to find a language or country by it's English name. A navbar is also present to allow the user to navigate back to the home page (the world map) or to the about page.

Ideas about pagination of extensive results has not been implemented. Points representing the location of each language in the database have not been implemented yet either.

NOTES: Resizing the window (more specifically, resizing the viewport) does not change the size of the map, unless the page is reloaded.
